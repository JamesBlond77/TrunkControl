TrunkControl is a RPH plugin which let's you open your trunk via one simple button click. I've created this mod whilst starting to learn more about C# and thought: Why not publish it?





How to install TrunkControl

Download the .rar and extract it via WinRAR or 7-Zip.
Drag and drop the Plugins folder into your GTA-V main directory.




How to load TrunkControl

There are two ways of how you can load the plugin:

Use "LoadPlugin TrunkControl" in the RPH console.
Load the plugin on startup (RPH settings)




Requirements

A legal copy of Grand Theft Auto V.
RagePluginHook 1.87 or higher which you can download here (You most likely already have it as it's a prerequisite for LSPDFR). 




Features

As stated above, TrunkControl let's you open your current vehicle trunk with one click (default T). The key is fully customisable and also supports controllers. 
Integrated version checker which always tells you if you are on the latest version or if you need to update the plugin. You can still play on an outdated version though I wouldn't recommend it (Massive thanks to @sEbi3 for open sorucing UnitedCallouts).




How to customise the key

You can simply change the key to open your trunk via the plugins .ini file (Plugins/TrunkControl/TrunkControl.ini). After changing the key (or button), you don't need to reload the entire plugin to use the new key. Entering the command "ReloadTrunkControlConfig" in the RagePluginHook reloads the config file.




Future development 

With gaining more and more knowledge about RAGE's API and C# I will always give my best to implement more features and update the plugin.
If you have any sort of suggestion, idea or improvement that helps the plugin and user experience please let me know via the comment section or send a DM my way.
